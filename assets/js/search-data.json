Secondly, after making this decision, there was no way back, which made it an extremely difficult choice. . At this point of the book, you also need to make a decision. There are many different database solutions and many different SQL flavours. This book covers couple of them, so you need to pick the one that you&#39;ll move on with.

Those discrepancie however are reasonable enough to make your knowledge universal most of the time. . Let&#39;s now start working on the database installation. In this book we use SQLite as a default option to show you the process. If you want to see instructions for other databases, visit one of the links: . Big Query (todo: in the backlog): link, | SQLite via Python (todo: in the backlog): link, | PostgreSQL (todo: in the backlog): link. | . TODO: matrix/table showing prons/cons of starting with each of the solutions TODO: maybe more info in general about different dbs . Let&#39;s get started! :muscle: . Install the database . In this section you&#39;ll see how to install the SQLite database. One of the reasons that SQLite is particurarly good starting point for learning is its simplicity. The entire database is contained in just one file. Setting it up is trivial. It requires hardly any installation and no configuration at all. It&#39;s free, so you can use it to its limits without worring about the costs. . Beware and don&#39;t let the simplicity disguise you. It is a fully reliable database with the features that you would expect from the modern SQL database. It&#39;s characteristics make it a perfect choice for: . smartphonoes and other devices, | websites, | data analytics, | and many more. | . Developers of the SQLite boast that it&#39;s likely the most popular database in the entire world. They also strive to keep it reliable until 2050. . Truth be told, SQLite as a bit different than its more traditional brothers - fully fledged relational database management systems (RDBMS), like PostgreSQL, SQL Server or Oracle. It&#39;s not a good choice for every use case. You may decide to choose an alternative, if your project requires: . accessing the database directly from many computers at the same time, | simultaneous modification of the data by many users, | working with very large amounts of data (although it officially can handle up to 281 terabytes, having to keep it in one file is the bottleneck here). | . It also has some unusual behaviours that are distinct from what you will find anywhere else. Everytime we face such behaviour, you will see a warning. You can also get familiar with the full list in advance using the official documentation. You can see an example of the warning below. . Warning: SQLite is not a replacement for more traditional solutions. Unlike most databases it doesn&#8217;t come with a dedicated server process and it&#8217;s self-contained in a file. It has its own, specific problem that it&#8217;s trying to solve. There&#39;s no perfect solution but the features of SQLite make it an amazing candidate for learning. With SQLite you&#39;ll get a great &quot;use the SQL in practice&quot; to &quot;try to setup the database&quot; ratio. And remember, you&#39;re not like Neo. You can always start with one option and switch to something else in the future :shipit: . Interact with your database .

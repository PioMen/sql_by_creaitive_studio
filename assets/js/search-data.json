Now that you saw an example of data project using SQL, you&#39;ll see how to build such project yourself. . Download the data . You can&#39;t do analytics without data. How you actually get it, depends on your project. When working on a business project, you may find the crucial datasets in a database of your company. That&#39;s quite convenient as you don&#39;t have to prepare and upload the data yourself. . Eventually you may stumble upon a limitations of the data at your disposal. Or you may want to work on your personal project, where you need to create your dataset from scratch. In such cases, ability to explore and use publically available datasets can be a very useful skill. There&#39;s no golden rule, but you might want to check sites like Kaggle, this repo, Dataset Search by Google or this subreddit looking for the right data for you. . In our example, we&#39;ll use the data on COVID-19 vaccinations shared by Our World in Data. You can find it in this repo.

Congratulations, you&#39;ve just completed the first step to get your data project up and running! . Install the database . Do you remember the cult movie from 1999 &quot;The Matrix&quot;? There was this very memorable scene where Neo was given a choice between two pills, the red one and the blue one. He had a one in a lifetime opportunity to decide whether he wants to go on living in lie or find out the truth. . There are two remarkable ascpects of this decision. First, one of the options feels to be objectively more &quot;correct&quot;. No one wants his life to be a lie. Secondly, after making this decision, there was no way back, which made it an extremely difficult choice. . At this point of the book, you also need to make a decision. There are many different database solutions and many different SQL flavours. This book covers couple of them, so you need to pick the one that you&#39;ll move on with. Compared to the dilemma that Neo faced, the decision that you are going to make is both easier and more difficult at the same time. . It&#39;s more difficult, because there is no answer which is more &quot;correct&quot; than the others. All solutions discussed in this book are widely used. All of them have advantages and disadvantages and there is no &quot;the right choice&quot;. Fortunately, unlike the Neo, you don&#39;t need to live with this decision for the rest of your life. Quite the opposite! You can start with one tool and later on come back to try another one. . It gets even better than that. There is a standard that describes the principles of the SQL language. It means that even if you learn one implementation of the SQL (e.g. SQLite) and want to switch to another one (e.g. PostgreSQL), you should be able to transfer most of your knowledge. To be clear, it doesn&#39;t mean that each vendor implements the language in an identical way. They try to follow the standard to some degree but there are some differences. Those discrepancie however are reasonable enough to make your knowledge universal most of the time. . sql lite default . TODO: matrix/table showing prons/cons of starting with each of the solutions . Interact with your database . Import the data . Run your first SQL query . Now we&#39;ll go through the SQL query that was used to prepare the data for our report. A query is a piece of SQL code that you use to get the data from the database. You can also use it to do all kinds of manipulations, like: aggregations, custom calculations, filtering, sorting and so on. . One of the reasons that I&#39;m such a huge fan of the SQL is its friendliness. SQL is a declarative language. It means that you don&#39;t need to specify all the low-lewel operations to get the desired result. You just need to describe the final outcome and the database will figure out the rest for you. .

There are plenty of great materials out there that will give you a full introduction and historical context to the subject of SQL, before moving to practice. In this book, we take a slightly different approach. I will try to give you an amount of information that is &quot;just right&quot; to get a rough understanding of the subject and start practicing. This approach has many benefits. One of them is that you will find out very soon if SQL is difficult and fun for YOU. . Tip: If you prefer to learn the more &quot;traditional&quot; way, &quot;SQL for Mere Mortals&quot; by John Viescas and Michael J. Hernandez (TODO: add link) is an amazing book that I can highly recommend. TODO: be more explicit about benefits of this approach . To give you an idea about what you may expect in this chapter, let me show you a plan that we will follow. First, I&#39;ll give you an example of the analytical project that was built using SQL. Then, you will go behind the curtain to get a step by step guide to recreate it on your own. At every step of the process, I will provide you with enough details to fully understand what you&#39;re doing. . Let&#39;s get some first orientation in the subject, without spending too much time on a lengthy introduction. Here&#39;s a subjective list of 5 reasons why I think it&#39;s hard to not love the SQL. . 1. Easy to learn If you are wondering if learning a computer language is for you, SQL is a great place to start. I believe that with the right approach, almost anyone can start using it comfortably in relatively short period of time (1-3 months). The syntax is very compact. All you need to do, is to get a good understanding of a couple of the basic operations and learn how to combine them in a Lego-like manner. With that gentle learning curce, you will very soon be able to see the first fruits of your work. . 2. Friendly but powerfull Learning a skill because it&#39;s easy to learn would make no sense if it was a uselless skill. Fortunately with SQL you get an awesome impact effort ratio. You can use it to work with all kinds of datasets (from hundreds, to billions of rows). That makes you quite capable in a data world. . 3. Great starting point Being so easy to learn but at the same time, so powerful, SQL is a great choice if you want to start your career in IT. As you probably know, the role of data in a modern world is increasing rapidly. There is a huge demand for professionals who know how to deal with data. It&#39;s not too challenging to find a satisfying job if you master this skill. What a bargain! . 4. Strong foundation Learning a language is just one part of working with data. Knowing how to do it efficiently is a whole different story. With SQL, you can get your hands dirty relatively quickly. It will allow you to learn skills that are hard to acquire otherwise. By that I mean things like being able to assess quality of the data, clean the data, verify quality of your scripts and debugging. These skills are transferable. You can easily build on them if you decide to take on a new tool for working with the data, like Python or Spark. . 5. Sweetspot between IT and business There is a group of people who like coding but could not imagine themself doing it day after day, all day long. If that sounds familiar, you&#39;ll be happy to know that it&#39;s not the only option. With SQL, you can look for a career path that involves reporting or analytics. The scope of work will obviously differ in a different companies, but most of the time, these kind of positions will give you a heathy balance of business problem solving, communication and coding. PS. Don&#39;t worry if you actually are into hardcore coding marathons, you should be able to find something for yourself too. . Tip: SQL vs spreadsheets If you are coming from a spreadsheet world, you probably wonder how does working with SQL compare to working with spreadsheets. The main benefit is that SQL is much better at providing consistency. Have you ever failed to update your formula when refreshing your report? That will not happen with SQL. You design your logic and keep it in an SQL script that will work exactly the same each and every time. It&#8217;s like you took all of your knowledge about what you need to do and wrote it down in a file. You don&#8217;t need to do every step yourself. You dramatically reduce the risk of a human error. . To be fair, like any other tool, SQL has it&#39;s own limitations as well. Here&#39;s the major one. . 1. Limited by design It&#39;s more of a feature that an issue but SQL was designed with a specific purpose in mind: manipulating data in a database. Having this assumption makes it a very friendly, logical and coherent language for this purpose. But it&#39;s fair to point out that it also imposes some limitations. If you&#39;re looking for a single tool that will manipulate the data, create some charts, save them to pdf and sent via e-mail - SQL is not a go to solution. It&#39;s a choice between versatility and accessibility. You can find tools that are more universal but they will surely have a steeper learning curve. SQL provides a great balance between the two. TODO: matrix - how complex vs how universal the tool is . Ok, so these are the main benefits of learning SQL. I hope that you now have a feeling about how accessible and enabling this skill is. I encourage you to give it a try. You will love it!` . A short advice . While learning SQL, you might want to get as much knowledge as possible from the effort that you invest. There&#39;s a simple trick that you can use to boost your chances of success. Would you skip this opportunity? . There are lots of reasons why you might want to learn a new skill. People are usually more succesfull when they have a very explicit goal in mind. So before you jump in to the book for good, take a minute or two, to think about your motivation. By motivation I mean, a specific outcome that you want to get after completing the material. When you&#39;re ready, write it down and keep it in a visible place, so you can take a look from time to time. At the very end, you&#39;ll be able to check how well you did pursuing your goal. . To make this technique work even better, think for a couple of minutes about the specific actions that you can take to achieve your goal. When you&#39;re ready, write them down. The more specific you get, the better. . Next, think about obstacles that may stand on your way and prevent you from taking actions that you&#39;ve just described. Write down all the ideas that you have. Think about ways to overcome these obstacles and make notes. This way, you&#39;ll be prepared when they start to affect you. . To better illustrate that. Your goal might be to &quot;start using SQL at your work&quot;. To achieve that, you plan to &quot;spend 30 minutes every day reading this book&quot;. The obstacle that can stand in your way is that &quot;you only have time for reading in the evening, when you&#39;re too tired&quot;. How to overcome that? You can try to &quot;get up half an hour earlier and start your day with learning&quot;. . Tip: If you&#8217;re looking for ways to increase the amount of time you have for learning or other activities, I highly recommend the &quot;Make Time&quot; book by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky. It&#8217;s a great guide that will teach you how to have more time to do things that you really want to do. Check it out! TODO: make time book link That&#39;s it, you&#39;re now prepared to start your learning journey effectively :rocket: . Important: If you would like to support this project and help others in their learning adventure, you can share your thoughts about goals, actions and obstacles using this link. I will use this information to think about ways of improving the content over time to help future readers achieve their goals. TODO: add link . SQL in action - the hands on approach . You should now have a very basic feeling about the benefits of learning SQL and hopefully some meaningful goal in mind. You will now see first-hand, how SQL can be used in practice. We will use this opportunity to clarify some concepts and prepare you for the next section, where you&#39;ll be given a chance to build similar project yourself. Buckle up! . First, try to imagine that you are a Data Analyst at a well known, data-driven company. Your job is to transform the data into insights and help to make a good business decisions. There are plenty of ways to do it. One of them is making this data available at a fingertips of the people in your company. You can achieve that by preparing and sharing all kinds of reports. . Modern companies use BI tools to address their reporting needs. A BI tool is a program designed specifically for this purpose. It allows to build reports, aka dashboards, that are automated, interactive and easy to share. An effective report prepared in a BI tool allows users to play with the data on their own. Filtering, drill down and other manipulations should be available in real time, without need to use help from a Data Analyst. . Some of the most popular BI tools, like Tableau, PowerBI or Data Studio, provide access to a so-called gallery. It&#39;s a place where you can find a colletion of sample dashboards prepared by the community. I really recommend you visiting them, to get a feeling of what you may expect from a modern BI tool (Tableau Gallery, PowerBI Data Stories Gallery, Data Studio Report Gallery). . In this book we&#39;ll use a simple dashboard to teach you about the lifecycle of exemplary analytical project built with SQL. It&#39;s a very simple report with a map that shows prices of different apartments offered for rent via AirBnB in Bergamo, Italy. . TODO URGENT: screenshot + link TODO URGENT: elaborate on the dashboard: you can see x, y; users can filter ... . You should now have a feeling how capable BI tools can be. They allow for interactivity unimaginable with traditional, static reports. A wise question to ask at this point would be, how can you actually start using such tool. . The answer is that most frequently, the first step is to connect your report to the data that you want to use. That&#39;s where SQL typically comes into play. It allows you to transform the data stored in a database and import it to the tool. After that, you can use different in-built functions to create a report. Finally, you can share your report with the audience. Below you can find a diagram that captures this process. . TODO: diagram of the high-level process: database -&gt; sql -&gt; data import -&gt; bi manipulations and sharing . In the next section we will discuss each of the steps in details, so you can build some understanding of these concepts. Next, you will see what actions were taken to create dashboard with AirBnB prices in Bergamo. You will also have a chance to get your hands dirty by trying to build it on your own :rocket: . DIY data project . Storing data in a database . What is a database? . Most companies store their data in some kind of a database. In the simplest words, a database in general is an organized collection of information. Notice, that at this point, there is no mention about computer systems or the amount of this information. The simplest database can be really simple. Only two components are required: . a piece of information and | some organized way to store it. . Tip: What&#8217;s the simplest example of a database that comes to your mind? Think about it for two minutes before reading on. The very basic database can be as simple as a shopping list. It can store information about what you want to buy. Slightly more complex examples would be a patient card, a phone book or a home budget. If you think about it, databases are everywhere. | . You&#39;ve probably noticed that a very basic database, like a shopping list, could be stored on something as simple as a single piece of paper. A phone book would require, well, lots of pages :sunglasses: To make it more convenient, an interactive application would be even better. For a home budget, a spreadsheet could be a wise choice. The general principle is, the more data you have, the more advanced tool you need. . As you can imagine, data used by companies is far more complex than what an average person typically use. Even a relatively simple business like a single, brick and mortar store, needs to keep and process information about each transaction, the supplies, bank account operations, accounting and so on. And that&#39;s just a tip of an iceberg. Companies may want to add to this list a bunch of non-required information that helps to build a competitive advantage, like store visitors (curious? see this), promotions, marketing campaigns, loyalty programs and many more. . TODO: update the link . Obviously, a chain of thousands of stores would need to handle this information at scale, for each and every physical locations. That&#39;s even without mentioning tech companies with thousands or millions of users that track every mouse movement and every key that you hit on your keyboard. In short, the amount of information used by the companies is overwhelming. . That&#39;s why being able to handle this information requires tools designed specifically with that purpose in mind. A database, in this context, would be a piece of software developed precisely to store and manage data. Modern databases are suitable to manage data at enterprise-level in a reliable, effective and secure way. From now on, whenever you see a word database in this book, that&#39;s what it means. . Database ecosystem is very rich with a variety of solutions. Some of them are being developed by huge corporations and offered commercially (e.g. Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server). Others are community-driven and free to use (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite). You can find solutions that work on-premises (you need to install them on your own computers), and cloud products that run on machines owned by a cloud provider. Finally, there is a group of more traditional, relational database systems and relatively new world of Big Data solutions. . If you pick two random database products, they can be entirely different in terms of the underlying concepts (e.g. MySQL vs Hive vs SQLite). As you can image, for a single mind, it would be extremely hard to grasp all the possible variations. Fortunately, despite all the complexity, most of the solutions provide a common interface for interacting with data. And that interface is not that difficult to understand. It&#39;s mainly built of tables. . TODO: possibly a link to comparison of concepts behind MySQL vs Hive vs SQLite . A look inside a database . That&#39;s right. If you open a database management app, you will most likely see two things: . a list of tables, often organized in groups (those groups are called either databases or projects, depending on the product that you use), | an SQL editor, where you can type in your SQL code. | . At this point it&#39;s probably quite hard to imagine. Fortunately you can see it with our own eyes. But first, you need a database. . Choose a database . Do you remember a cult movie from 1999 &quot;The Matrix&quot;? There was this very memorable scene where Neo was given a choice between two pills, the red one and the blue one. He had a one in a lifetime opportunity to decide whether he wants to go on living in lie or find out the truth. . There are two remarkable ascpects of this decision. First, one of the options feels to be objectively more &quot;correct&quot;. No one wants his life to be a lie. Secondly, after making this decision, there was no way back, which made it an extremely difficult choice. . At this point, you also need to make a decision. As already mentioned, there are many different database solutions. This book covers a couple of them (currently two, more to come!). You need to pick one that you&#39;ll move on with. Compared to the dilemma that Neo faced, the decision that you are going to make is both easier and more difficult at the same time. . It&#39;s more difficult, because there is no answer which is more &quot;correct&quot; than the others. All solutions discussed in this book are widely used. All of them have advantages and disadvantages and there is no &quot;the right choice&quot;. A good side of things is that, unlike Neo, you don&#39;t need to live with this decision for the rest of your life. Quite the opposite! You can start with one tool and later on come back to try another one. . We&#39;re jumping a bit ahead but it&#39;s important to realise that although most providers support SQL, there are multiple variations of this language. Providers often implement certain functionalities in their own way. In practice it means that code created to work with one database, unless very basic, would not work with another one. . Thankfully, there is a standard that describes the principles of the SQL language. Providers do not implement it strictly, but conveniently it&#39;s followed to some degree. Even though we have different SQL flavours, which are not identical, the core principles remain the same. As a result if you learn one SQL flavour, you should be able to easily swith to a different one (probably after some googling here and there). . TODO: examples of differences will always select, from, where but to_date might be different . Note: In this book you will be informed whenever we use a solution that is specific to a given SQL implementation. . Here&#39;s the main takeaway for you. If you have a good reason to use one implementation over the other, start with this implementation. A good example of such reason could be knowing that you will need to use a specific SQL flavour soon. Otherwise don&#39;t spend too much time thinking about it. No matter what solution you start with, you will be able to transfer almost all of your knowledge later on. . From now on we&#39;ll use SQLite to show you the process. If you want to see instructions for other databases, visit one of the links: . Big Query: (todo: in progress), | SQLite via Python: (todo: in the backlog), | PostgreSQL: (todo: in the backlog). | . TODO: think about a matrix comparing different solutions: e.g. easy to set up, cloud vs self-hosted, capabilities) . Install a database (SQLite) . In this section you&#39;ll see how to install the SQLite database. One of the reasons that SQLite is particurarly good starting point for learning is its simplicity. The entire database is contained in just one file. Setting it up is trivial. It requires hardly any installation and no configuration at all. It&#39;s free, so you can use it to its limits without worring about the costs. Developers of the SQLite boast that it&#39;s likely the most popular database in the entire world. They aim to keep it reliable until 2050. . Note: As for now, the book shows all the steps needed to install SQLite on Windows 10. If you&#8217;re using other OS, you might want to pick Big Query. Having a browser installed is the only requirement to make it work. Truth be told, SQLite is as a bit different than most of the other solutions out there. It is a fully reliable database with most of the features that you would expect from a modern solution. However it&#39;s characteristics, like storing all the data in one file, make it more suitable for: . smartphones and other devices, | websites, | data analytics. | . You may want to look for the alternative, if your project requires: . accessing the database from many computers at the same time, | simultaneous modification of the data by many users, | working with very large amounts of data (although it officially can handle up to 281 terabytes, having to keep it in one file is the bottleneck here). | . SQLite has some unusual behaviours that are distinct from what you will find anywhere else. Everytime we face such behaviour, you will be informed about it. You can also get familiar with the full list in advance using the official documentation. . All of that just confirms that there is no single perfect solution. However, features of SQLite make it an amazing candidate for learning. You will set it up in no time that will ensure a great ratio of &quot;using the SQL in practice&quot; vs &quot;struggling to setup the database&quot;. Let&#39;s now get it up and running :muscle: . There are two ways of creating a new SQLite database described in this book. The first one, which we call &quot;simple installation&quot;, allows you to set up a new database with just few clicks. I recommended using it as it&#39;s the quickest route to start using SQL in practice. . The &quot;advanced installation&quot; is only included because it&#39;s the official way of creating new database files described in the documentation. It requires using a command line, which makes it a bit more complex. Feel free to check it out and don&#39;t hesistate to switch back to the simple solution if you get stuck. There is no point to invest too much here. In the following sections it won&#39;t matter which solution you&#39;ve chosen. . Both solutions will require you having SQLiteStudio on your computer. It&#39;s an app that provides a user-friendly interface, where you can actually see what&#39;s inside your SQLite database and run your SQL queries. We&#39;ll use this tool very frequently until the end of this book. It&#39;s free, intuitive and very easy to start with. Let&#39;s see how to install it. . Visit official SQLiteStudio website and click &quot;Download&quot; button. | You should see a new &quot;sqlitestudio-{version}.zip&quot; zip file on your computer ({version} is a version number, for example 3.3.3). Unzip the file. You should see an &quot;SQLiteStudio&quot; directory after opening the unzipped folder that appeared on your computer. | This step is optional but recommended. Move the &quot;SQLiteStudio&quot; folder to the place, where you would like to store it permamently (e.g. your C: drive). You can create a shortcut to &quot;SQLiteStudio.exe&quot; file for easy access e.g. from your Desktop. | You&#39;re now ready to start using SQLiteStudio after opening &quot;SQLiteStudio.exe&quot; file that you can find in &quot;SQLiteStudio&quot; directory. . Tip: It&#8217;s possible that you will be shown a Windows warning about opening non-trusted application. &quot;SQLiteStudio&quot; is an open source project and all of its code is available for the public. As you can find out in the official GitHub repo, it&#8217;s maintained for a couple of years and many people are using it. You should be able to safely ignore the warning. That&#39;s it! No further installation required. You can now create a new database and start using it inside SQLiteStudio. | Simple installation . A simple approach to create a new database is fully based on using your brand-new SQLiteStudio app. . Open the SQLiteStudio, click on the &quot;Database&quot; menu and then select &quot;Add a database&quot; option. | Keep &quot;SQLite 3&quot; as a database type. Click on a green icon &quot;Create new database file&quot;. | Remember that SQLite database is just a file? You are now able to select path and name of your database file (accomodation.db). | By checking the &quot;Permanent&quot; option you will make sure that you see your database each time you open the app. | Finally, you can now &quot;Test connection&quot; and hit &quot;OK&quot; if everything works fine. You should be now able to find a new accomodation.db file in the path that you&#39;ve specified before. | Great! You&#39;ve just created a new database that is ready to be used. . Advanced installation . First you need to visit the SQLite Download Page. You&#39;ll see a list with different sections. Go to &quot;Precompiled Binaries for Windows&quot; and find the link for &quot;bundle of command-line tools&quot;. Click on the link to download the .zip file. . | Right click the .zip file and uncompress it. SQLite is portable, you don&#39;t need to install it. Actually, you can start using it right now. . | Go to catalog with three files: &quot;sqldiff.exe&quot;, &quot;sqlite3.exe&quot; and &quot;sqlite3_analyzer.exe&quot; and open &quot;sqldiff.exe&quot;. . | You will now see a terminal where you are able to run different SQLite commands. To create a database, we need to use following command .open your_path, where your_path stands for the path of your new database. You can replace it with ./accomodation.db that will create a new database inside your current directory. The full command would be .open ./accomodation.db. If you wan&#39;t to provide a full path, you need to use &quot;/&quot; instead of &quot; &quot; to specify it. . | You can double check if it worked by going to the folder and checking if you can see a new database file ./accomodation.db. . Tip: If you don&#8217;t see the file with your database, try typing .databases insinde the SQLite terminal and double check once again. . | You can now close your terminal. You&#39;ve just successfully created an SQLite database! . Tip: If for some reason you struggle to create a new database using this approach, it might be easier to ease SQLiteStudio for this purpose. It&#8217;s an alternative way of achieving the same results. | TODO: review above section - simple/advanced installation is probably not the best name . database is empty, we need to import some data .

When working on a business project, you may find the crucial datasets in a database of your company. That&#39;s quite convenient as you don&#39;t have to prepare and upload the data yourself. . Eventually you may stumble upon a limitations of the data at your disposal. Or you may want to work on your personal project, where you need to create your dataset from scratch. In such cases, ability to explore and use publically available datasets can be a very useful skill. There&#39;s no golden rule, but you might want to check sites like Kaggle, this repo, Dataset Search by Google or this subreddit looking for the right data for you. . In our example, we&#39;ll use the data on COVID-19 vaccinations shared by Our World in Data. You can find it in this repo. To download the data, follow the steps: . visit this link, | click on the little Raw button in the upper right corner, | when you see a comma delimited text right-click on top of it and select Save as.. option to save the file on your computer. TODO: screnshoots to bullets above? TODO: you might be wondering if there is a better way to download this file, clone repo? curl? | . Congratulations, you&#39;ve just completed the first step to get your data project up and running! As you may notice, it&#39;s a very simple dataset with just one table of data. We&#39;ll switch to more complex datasets later in the book. . Import the data . TODO: again, to detailed??? . To import the dataset right click on the database name in the &quot;Databases&quot; pane or click on the &quot;Tools&quot; menu and select an &quot;Import&quot; option. You will be asked to provide database and table names that will store your data. We only have one database at this point. For the name you can choose whatever you want. We&#39;ll be using &quot;country_vaccinations&quot; name in the following sections of this book. . After hitting &quot;next&quot; you will be asked to specify a couple of options: . data source type - the format of input file that you&#39;re using, CSV in our case; | input file - path to the file with your data; | text encoding - we&#39;ll just use default system encoding; | ignore errors - whether you want to stop the import in case of any errors, make sure to leave it unchecked; | first line represents CSV column names - whether the first row in your file represents column names; | field separator - character that is used to separate column in your file; | null values - we&#39;ll explore this option later in the book. | . To make a proper selection for some options, you need to know how your csv file is built. You can do it quite easily. Under the hood a csv file is just a text document representing a table of data. Each new line represents a new row and columns are separated with some character. Comma is the most popular choice, hence the name &quot;comma-separated values&quot;. You can also stumble upon other separators, like semicolon (&quot;;&quot;) or tab (&quot; t&quot;). . Technically the csv name and file extension are not a perfect fit if you don&#39;t use commas as your separators. However, you&#39;ll often see that people use this format anyway even when the separator is different. As it&#39;s still a text file, it will work just fine. . Tip: You may come across a &quot;tsv&quot; file. It&#8217;s a specific name for a delimited file that uses tabs as separators. In most of the tools, you should be able to import it using &quot;import csv&quot; option and selecting tab or &quot; t&quot; as your delimiter. Back in our case, to check if the first line of our file contains header, you can open it using any text editor. Notepad is the simplest option. Right click on your file, choose &quot;Open with...&quot; and select Notepad from the list. When you have your file opened, you can check the first line of the text. You will see values like: &quot;country&quot;, &quot;iso_code&quot;, &quot;date&quot;, &quot;total_vaccinations&quot; which definitely look like a column names. Make sure to check &quot;first line represents CSV column names&quot; option in SQLiteStudio. . Last but not least, field separator. Looking at couple of the first rows, you can clearly see that values are separated with commas, e.g.: &quot;country,iso_code,date,total_vaccinations...&quot;, &quot;Albania,ALB,2021-01-10,0.0...&quot;. Make sure to select &quot;, (comma)&quot; as a field separator. . You&#39;re now ready to import your data. Click a &quot;Finish&quot; button to start the process. After a short moment, you will see a new table in your database. . Run your first SQL query . Running the query . TODO: consider intro to creating SQL queries here already - but I&#39;m a bit reluctant (maybe very basic: if you want to use diff table change this, if you want to change columns, change that) . Now we&#39;ll go through the sample SQL query that is very similar to the one used in our report. A query is a piece of SQL code that you use to get the data from the database. You can also use it to do all kinds of manipulations, like: aggregations, custom calculations, filtering, sorting and so on. . One of the reasons that I&#39;m such a huge fan of the SQL is its friendliness. SQL is a declarative language. It means that you don&#39;t need to specify all the low-lewel operations to get the desired result. You just need to describe the final outcome and the database will figure out the rest for you. . TODO: diagram to illustrate the point above TODO: replace queries with the new dataset . If you have some basic knowledge of English, you may be suprised that a simple SQL query can be nearly understandable to you. . SELECT country, date, daily_vaccinations FROM covid.country_vaccinations WHERE COUNTRY = &#39;United States&#39; ORDER BY date DESC; . It almost feels like a pseudocode. The cool thing is that it&#39;s an actual working query. You start with choosing or selecting columns that you want to use. Next, you specify which database and which table you want to get your data from. You only request rows where certain condition is met. Finally you put your results into specific order. You probably wouldn&#39;t be able to write it yourself but it makes an intuitive sence. We&#39;ll spend much more time learning how to build your own sql queries later in the book. . You can try to execute this query inside the SQLiteStudio. Click on Tools in the top menu and select &quot;Open SQL editor&quot;. You will see a new window where you can type some text. Copy or even better rewrite the SQL code inside this editor. . Tip: Although copying and rewriting the code will provide you with the same result, typing the code yourself can be an effective learning technique. . To execute the query and see results you can either click on the &quot;play button&quot; or hit &quot;F9&quot; on your keyboard. Outcome will be displayed in a table below the editor. As expected, you should see information about daily vaccinations in USA sorted descending by date. . Formatting the query . If this is the first time you use SQL code, you&#39;ll probably start to have questions. . Does capitalization matter? | Do I need to keep split the code into lines in the same way? | Will it work if I don&#39;t indent? | Is semicolon at the end required? | . Before I give you answers, let me emphasize how cool it is to write code. In real or &quot;physical&quot; life, if you try some approach that doesn&#39;t work, most often than not, you break something. Usually it&#39;s painful because you need to either fix or replace whatever is broken. Writing code is a completely different world. Very often the worst thing that can happen is seeing an error. It&#39;s almost like you are in a wonderland where you can push your imagination to the limits withouth caring too much about consequences. Of course if you push to hard, you are capable of causing some damage but I can assure you that it won&#39;t happen while writing basic SQL queries. Having say that, I&#39;d strongly recommend you pausing here for a moment an testing yourself what can happen if you violate any of the assumptions from the list above. . TODO: some graphic to avoid spoilers? . Ready to find out the answer? Try using the code below and see what happens. . select country, date, daily_vaccinations from covid.country_vaccinations where country = &#39;United States&#39; order by date desc; . Good news is that nothing exploded. Even better news is that it works exactly the same as the previous version. If it doesn&#39;t matter why bother splitting the code or making indentations? In short, all those things do not matter for the computer. The thing is that we&#39;re not computers. It&#39;s much more easy and predictable to read, modify and work with the query if it&#39;s nicely formatted. Especially if it&#39;s a long and a complex one. You can already notice the difference in the simple example above. Imagine having not ten but a hundred lines of code that you need to update. . Your future self will probably not thank you if you take a good care about formatting. But you can be sure that it will curse if you don&#39;t. That&#39;s why this book follows a couple of simple principles when formatting code. . Create a new line for each main keyword (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY), column, where condition, expression. | Indent everything between main keywords. | Use semicolon to split many queries written one after the other (it makes your editor aware that these are separate pieces of code). | Capitalize keywords (that&#39;s my latest principle that I&#39;m least strict about). | This is a set of principles that I&#39;ve worked out using SQL for years. They tend to work very well for me. It&#39;s not fully comprehensive list and definitely not written in stone. As fair as I know, there is no one standard that everyone should follow. Feel free to experiment and modify the assumptions above to craft your own formatting style. As long as you keep your future self and your colleagues in mind, you should be fine. . Share your work . TODO: adjust to the context already given . When you have your data prepared, it&#39;s time to share it with your audience. You can do it in many different ways. One of the most effective ones is creating an interactive dashboard. In the next section you&#39;ll see how to set up a bi tool on your machine to start working on the first vizualizations. This section is not strictly related with the SQL language itself so you might be tempted to skip it over. Having in mind that presenting the data is one of the most important parts of the data project, I&#39;d recommend at least taking a quick look. This way you&#39;ll build a high-level understanding of the process. . Install a BI tool . TODO: adjust to the context already given TODO: maybe less details for obvious instructoins . There are plenty of great BI tools on the market. They differ in features, pricing models and ease of use. We won&#39;t compare them here as this river is vastly too deep to go into. Instead, we&#39;ll use one tool, PowerBi in our case. It&#39;s very robust, popular and fast developing. In short, it&#39;s a tool that&#39;s worth knowing in general. Plus it&#39;s free to install on your computer, although buying a commercial license is required to share your work with others. . You can install PowerBi from the official Microsoft website. Click the &quot;Download&quot; button and follow the instruction. . After succesfull installation, you should be able to open PowerBI Desktop. You&#39;ll see some prompts that will help you to log in or buy a licencse if you need one. You can ignore them at the moment to go to the main interface of the tool. . TODO: screenshot: prompt TODO: screenshot: you should see similar interface . If you select &quot;Get data&quot; from the &quot;Home&quot; menu, you&#39;ll see that PowerBI works with many different data sources out of the box, without further configuration required. . TODO: screenshot . Unfortunately, SQLite is an exception in this case. To make the two applications talk to each other, you need to install additional driver that you can find here. Depending on whether you&#39;are on 32 or 64-bit version of windows, choose either &quot;sqliteodbc.exe&quot; or &quot;sqliteodbc_w64.exe&quot;. After successfull installation, you&#39;ll be able to connect your PowerBI Desktop app to the SQLite database prepared in the previous step. . Connect BI tool to the database . There&#39;s one step that will make your life much easier you take care about it right know. You can define a DSN (data source name) that you&#39;ll be able to reuse in the future. This way you&#39;ll avoid providing a configuration each time you want to connect to your database. . To achieve that, open windows start menu and search for &quot;ODBC Data Sources&quot; (32- or 64-bit depending on your system). Open it and click on the &quot;Add&quot; button. After successful installation in the previous step, you should be able to see &quot;SQLite3 ODBC Driver&quot; option. Select it and click &quot;Finish&quot;. You&#39;ll see a window where you need to provide two kinds of information: Data Source Name and Database Name. Data Source Name is just a name that you can define for your data source. You can choose whatever you want, I&#39;d suggest using &quot;covid&quot; if you want to be aligned with the book. In Database Name you need to provide a path to your database. You can find the file using &quot;Browse...&quot; button or provide it on your own. Confirm your choices by clicking &quot;Ok&quot; button and you&#39;re good to go. . Open your PowerBI Desktop app. To make the connection, go to the &quot;Home&quot; menu and click on the &quot;Get data&quot; icon. Choose &quot;more...&quot; to open a new window where you&#39;ll be able to find &quot;ODBC&quot; option. After selecting it, click on the &quot;Connect&quot; button. You should be able to see the name of data source that you&#39;ve just defined. Select it and expand &quot;Advanced options&quot;. . In the SQL statement box, you can use a custom sql to extract the data. If you don&#39;t specify it, you&#39;ll be able to use the entire table. That&#39;s good for our small, example dataset. Probably not very good for big, productional data sources. Let&#39;s use the query from the previous sections. Because we are connecting specifically to the covid db, we need to remove covid. prefix in the from clause. . SELECT country, date, daily_vaccinations FROM country_vaccinations WHERE COUNTRY = &#39;United States&#39; ORDER BY date DESC; . To complete the process, paste the above query and hit &quot;Ok&quot;. Make sure that you understand how it differs from the version used in SQLiteStudio. When asked about password, switch to the &quot;Default or Custom&quot; option in the menu, leave all the field blank and continue. If everything went right, you&#39;ll see a table with sample data. Click &quot;Load&quot; to import it to PowerBI. After the whole process you will see your data import in the &quot;Fields&quot; menu. . Prepare your first dashboard . The last step is to start working on your dashboard. PowerBi allows you to create all kinds of visualizations, like: tables, charts, maps or even animations. In this book we won&#39;t focus too much on the PowerBI itself. We&#39;ll just create a basic chart to complete our mini data project and see the big picture. Feel free to play around with different kinds of visualizations if you want. You can try to re-create a dashboard that I&#39;ve shown you at the very beginning. . TODO: recommend some resource about PowerBI TODO: instruction to re-create my dashboard (video??) TODO: one more sql to create a map?? . If you have your PowerBI open, you can go to the &quot;Fields&quot; menu, right-click on your query and &quot;Edit query&quot;. If you do so, you&#39;ll see that all of our columns are of the &quot;string&quot; type. That&#39;s not what we want, as we&#39;d like PowerBI to be able to e.g. sum numeric values or understand the dates properly. You can change it directly in PowerBI by clicking on the data type icon and choosing a proper option. TODO: it&#39;s a good moment to start talking about data types . The last step is to create a chart itself. In our case we&#39;ll prepare a very basic table. Select a table icon from the &quot;Visualizations&quot; pane and and check &quot;daily_vaccinations&quot; and &quot;date&quot; fields from your data source. PowerBI will place them on a table for you. . That&#39;s it, you&#39;ve just created you first end-to-end data project :rocket: You&#39;ve set up a database, imported your data, run an sql query and prepared a first visualization. You can be proud of yourself :cocktail: In the next sections we&#39;ll dive deeper in particular parts of the flow. We&#39;ll focus of course on the sql query preparation. . Teach others . Ever heard of the &quot;see one, do one, teach one&quot; method? It&#39;s used to increase the amount of information that you retain while learning. It&#39;s especially common in the medical training. As you only retain 10% of what you read and 20% of what you hear, we&#39;re looking for a ways to use your time in a more effective way. . TODO: remove poor jokes . You might have not noticed but you&#39;ve just been guided to complete the two first steps of the process. You&#39;ve seen an example of a data product and you&#39;ve done it yourself. So the last step is to teach others about what you&#39;ve just learned. You can try explaining it to someone close to you. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m a realist. I&#39;m aware that chances are you either: a) do not have such person available at hand, b) you have such person but you want to keep it that way, so you prefer to avoid forcing that person to listen about coding. . Fair enough. Fortunately, there are plenty of people who could actualy use your help already at this point. I&#39;ve set up a space where you can see questions related to the material covered in this section. Do your best to answer them and publish your answers so other people can see them. Others can upvote your answer if they find it helpful. You can do the same with other responses. To ensure that you get as much as possible from the time that you&#39;ve already invested into the learning process, I&#39;d really encourage you to spend some time to: . publish your own response without peeking at the answers already provided, | take a look at the responses provided by others, to verify your understanding. | . TODO: set up this space TODO: provide a link to this space TODO: list of questions . Now that you have high level understanding of the process and SQL in general, we can move on to the second part. In that section we&#39;ll dive deep into specific concepts to make your more comfortable creating your own queries. .",

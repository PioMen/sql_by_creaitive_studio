Now that you saw an example of data project using SQL, you&#39;ll see how to build such project yourself. . Download the data . You can&#39;t do analytics without data. How you actually get it depends on your project. When working on a business project, you may find the crucial datasets in a database of your company. That&#39;s quite convenient as you don&#39;t have to prepare and upload the data yourself. . Eventually you might stumble upon a limitations of the data at your disposal. Or you might want to work on your personal project. In such case it might be worth to check out the datasets that are publically available. . In such case, most of the time, you won&#39;t need to upload it yourself. For you personal projects you might want to check platforms . In our case, we&#39;ll just use . Install the database . TODO: Blue Pill or Red Pill? . Interact with your database . Import the data . Run your first SQL query . Now we&#39;ll go through the SQL query that was used to prepare the data for our report. A query is a piece of SQL code that you use to get the data from the database. You can also use it to do all kinds of manipulations, like: aggregations, custom calculations, filtering, sorting and so on. . One of the reasons that I&#39;m such a huge fan of the SQL is its friendliness. SQL is a declarative language. It means that you don&#39;t need to specify all the low-lewel operations to get the desired result. You just need to describe the final outcome and the database will figure out the rest for you. . TODO: diagram to illustrate the point above . If you have some basic knowledge of English, you may be suprised that a simple SQL query can be nearly understandable to you. . TODO: simple SQL . It almost feels like a pseudocode. The cool thing is that it&#39;s an actual working query. . TODO: explain the meaning of select, from etc. . Let&#39;s see what happens when you run this code. . TODO: run code and show results from db You can now try to execute this query inside the database managament app of your choice. . Visualize your insights .",

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .

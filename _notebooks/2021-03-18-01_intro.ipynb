In this book, we take a slightly different approach. I will try to give you an amount of information that is \"just right\" to get a rough understanding of the subject and start practicing. This approach has many benefits. One of them is that you will find out very soon if SQL is difficult and fun for YOU.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: If you prefer to learn the more \"traditional\" way, \"SQL for Mere Mortals\" by John Viescas and Michael J. Hernandez (```TODO: add link```) is an amazing book that I can highly recommend.\n",
    "\n",
    "```TODO: be more explicit about benefits of this approach```\n",
    "\n",
    "To give you an idea about what you may expect in this chapter, let me show you a plan that we will follow. First, I'll give you an example of the analytical project that was built using SQL. Then, you will go behind the curtain to get a step by step guide to recreate it on your own. At every step of the process, I will provide you with enough details to fully understand what you're doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get some first orientation in the subject, without spending too much time on a lengthy introduction. Here's a subjective list of 5 reasons why I think it's hard to not love the SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Easy to learn**\n",
    "If you are wondering if learning a computer language is for you, SQL is a great place to start. I believe that with the right approach, almost anyone can start using it comfortably in relatively short period of time (1-3 months). The syntax is very compact. All you need to do, is to get a good understanding of a couple of the basic operations and learn how to combine them in a Lego-like manner. With that gentle learning curce, you will very soon be able to see the first fruits of your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Friendly but powerfull**\n",
    "Learning a skill because it's easy to learn would make no sense if it was a uselless skill. Fortunately with SQL you get an awesome impact effort ratio. You can use it to work with all kinds of datasets (from hundreds, to billions of rows). That makes you quite capable in a data world.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Great starting point**\n",
    "Being so easy to learn but at the same time, so powerful, SQL is a great choice if you want to start your career in IT. As you probably know, the role of data in a modern world is increasing rapidly. There is a huge demand for professionals who know how to deal with data. It's not too challenging to find a satisfying job if you master this skill. What a bargain!\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Strong foundation**\n",
    "Learning a language is just one part of working with data. Knowing how to do it efficiently is a whole different story. With SQL, you can get your hands dirty relatively quickly. It will allow you to learn skills that are hard to acquire otherwise. By that I mean things like being able to assess quality of the data, clean the data, verify quality of your scripts and debugging. These skills are transferable. You can easily build on them if you decide to take on a new tool for working with the data, like Python or Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Sweetspot between IT and business**\n",
    "There is a group of people who like coding but could not imagine themself doing it day after day, all day long. If that sounds familiar, you'll be happy to know that it's not the only option. With SQL, you can look for a career path that involves reporting or analytics. The scope of work will obviously differ in a different companies, but most of the time, these kind of positions will give you a heathy balance of business problem solving, communication and coding.\n",
    "PS. Don't worry if you actually are into hardcore coding marathons, you should be able to find something for yourself too.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: **SQL vs spreadsheets** If you are coming from a spreadsheet world, you probably wonder how does working with SQL compare to working with spreadsheets. The main benefit is that SQL is much better at providing consistency. Have you ever failed to update your formula when refreshing your report? That will not happen with SQL. You design your logic and keep it in an SQL script that will work exactly the same each and every time. It's like you took all of your knowledge about what you need to do and wrote it down in a file. You don't need to do every step yourself. You dramatically reduce the risk of a human error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To be fair, like any other tool, SQL has it's own limitations as well. Here's the major one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Limited by design**\n",
    "It's more of a feature that an issue but SQL was designed with a specific purpose in mind: manipulating data in a database. Having this assumption makes it a very friendly, logical and coherent language for this purpose. But it's fair to point out that it also imposes some limitations. If you're looking for a single tool that will manipulate the data, create some charts, save them to pdf and sent via e-mail - SQL is not a go to solution. It's a choice between versatility and accessibility. You can find tools that are more universal but they will surely have a steeper learning curve. SQL provides a great balance between the two.\n",
    "```TODO: matrix - how complex vs how universal the tool is```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so these are the main benefits of learning SQL. I hope that you now have a feeling about how accessible and enabling this skill is. I encourage you to give it a try. You will love it!`"

    "\n",
    "There are lots of reasons why you might want to learn a new skill. People are usually more succesfull when they have a very explicit goal in mind. So before you jump in to the book for good, take a minute or two, to think about your motivation. By motivation I mean, a specific outcome that you want to get after completing the material. When you're ready, write it down and keep it in a visible place, so you can take a look from time to time. At the very end, you'll be able to check how well you did pursuing your goal.\n",

The obstacle that can stand in your way is that \"you only have time for reading in the evening, when you're too tired\". How to overcome that? You can try to \"get up half an hour earlier and start your day with learning\".\n",

The entire database is contained in just one file. Setting it up is trivial. It requires hardly any installation and no configuration at all. It's free, so you can use it to its limits without worring about the costs.

It's almost like you are in a wonderland where you can push your imagination to the limits withouth caring too much about consequences. Of course if you push to hard, you are capable of causing some damage but I can assure you that it won't happen while writing basic SQL queries.

It's much more easy and predictable to read, modify and work with the query if it's nicely formatted. Especially if it's a long and a complex one.

    "Do you remember the cult movie from 1999 \"The Matrix\"? There was this very memorable scene where Neo was given a choice between two pills, the red one and the blue one. He had a one in a lifetime opportunity to decide whether he wants to go on living in lie or find out the truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two remarkable ascpects of this decision. First, one of the options feels to be objectively more \"correct\". No one wants his life to be a lie. Secondly, after making this decision, there was no way back, which made it an extremely difficult choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point of the book, you also need to make a decision. There are many different database solutions and many different SQL flavours. This book covers couple of them, so you need to pick the one that you'll move on with. Compared to the dilemma that Neo faced, the decision that you are going to make is both easier and more difficult at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's more difficult, because there is no answer which is more \"correct\" than the others. All solutions discussed in this book are widely used. All of them have advantages and disadvantages and there is no \"the right choice\". Fortunately, unlike the Neo, you don't need to live with this decision for the rest of your life. Quite the opposite! You can start with one tool and later on come back to try another one.\n",
    "\n",
    "It gets even better than that. There is a standard that describes the principles of the SQL language. It means that even if you learn one implementation of the SQL (e.g. SQLite) and want to switch to another one (e.g. PostgreSQL), you should be able to transfer most of your knowledge. To be clear, it doesn't mean that each vendor implements the language in an identical way. They try to follow the standard to some degree but there are some differences. Those discrepancie however are reasonable enough to make your knowledge universal most of the time.\n",

It's free, so you can use it to its limits without worring about the costs.\n",

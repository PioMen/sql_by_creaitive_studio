    "Do you remember the cult movie from 1999 \"The Matrix\"? There was this very memorable scene where Neo was given a choice between two pills, the red one and the blue one. He had a one in a lifetime opportunity to decide whether he wants to go on living in lie or find out the truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two remarkable ascpects of this decision. First, one of the options feels to be objectively more \"correct\". No one wants his life to be a lie. Secondly, after making this decision, there was no way back, which made it an extremely difficult choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point of the book, you also need to make a decision. There are many different database solutions and many different SQL flavours. This book covers couple of them, so you need to pick the one that you'll move on with. Compared to the dilemma that Neo faced, the decision that you are going to make is both easier and more difficult at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's more difficult, because there is no answer which is more \"correct\" than the others. All solutions discussed in this book are widely used. All of them have advantages and disadvantages and there is no \"the right choice\". Fortunately, unlike the Neo, you don't need to live with this decision for the rest of your life. Quite the opposite! You can start with one tool and later on come back to try another one.\n",
    "\n",
    "It gets even better than that. There is a standard that describes the principles of the SQL language. It means that even if you learn one implementation of the SQL (e.g. SQLite) and want to switch to another one (e.g. PostgreSQL), you should be able to transfer most of your knowledge. To be clear, it doesn't mean that each vendor implements the language in an identical way. They try to follow the standard to some degree but there are some differences. Those discrepancie however are reasonable enough to make your knowledge universal most of the time.\n",

The entire database is contained in just one file. Setting it up is trivial. It requires hardly any installation and no configuration at all. It's free, so you can use it to its limits without worring about the costs.\n",

    "- data analytics,\n",
    "- and many more.\n",

    "- accessing the database directly from many computers at the same time,\n",
    "- simultaneous modification of the data by many users,\n",
    "- working with very large amounts of data (although it officially can handle up to 281 terabytes, having to keep it in one file is the bottleneck here).\n",
    "\n",
    "It also has some unusual behaviours that are distinct from what you will find anywhere else. Everytime we face such behaviour, you will see a warning. You can also get familiar with the full list in advance using [the official documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/quirks.html). You can see an example of the warning below.\n",

    "> Warning: SQLite is not a replacement for more traditional solutions. Unlike most databases it doesn't come with a dedicated server process and it's self-contained in a file. It has its own, specific problem that it's trying to solve.\n",

    "There's no perfect solution but the features of SQLite make it an amazing candidate for learning. With SQLite you'll get a great \"use the SQL in practice\" to \"try to setup the database\" ratio. And remember, you're not like Neo. You can always start with one option and switch to something else in the future :shipit:"

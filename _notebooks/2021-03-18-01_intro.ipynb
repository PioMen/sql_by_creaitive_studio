    "Do you remember a cult movie from 1999 \"The Matrix\"? There was this very memorable scene where Neo was given a choice between two pills, the red one and the blue one. He had a one in a lifetime opportunity to decide whether he wants to go on living in lie or find out the truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two remarkable ascpects of this decision. First, one of the options feels to be objectively more \"correct\". No one wants his life to be a lie. Secondly, after making this decision, there was no way back, which made it an extremely difficult choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you also need to make a decision. As already mentioned, there are many different database solutions. This book covers a couple of them (currently two, more to come!). You need to pick one that you'll move on with. Compared to the dilemma that Neo faced, the decision that you are going to make is both easier and more difficult at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's more difficult, because there is no answer which is more \"correct\" than the others. All solutions discussed in this book are widely used. All of them have advantages and disadvantages and there is no \"the right choice\". A good side of things is that, unlike Neo, you don't need to live with this decision for the rest of your life. Quite the opposite! You can start with one tool and later on come back to try another one.\n",

    "In this section you'll see how to install the SQLite database. One of the reasons that SQLite is particurarly good starting point for learning is its simplicity. The entire database is contained in just one file. Setting it up is trivial. It requires hardly any installation and no configuration at all. It's free, so you can use it to the limit without worring about the costs. Developers of the SQLite estimate that it's likely the [most popular database in the entire world](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html). They strive to keep it reliable until 2050. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: As for now, the book shows all the steps needed to install SQLite on Windows 10. If you're using other OS, you might want to pick [Big Query](https://creaitive.studio/sql/2021/03/18/01_intro_big_query.html) instead. Having a browser installed is the only requirement to make it work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Truth be told, SQLite is as a bit different than most of the other solutions out there. It is a fully reliable database with most of the features that you would expect from a modern solution. However it's characteristics, like storing all the data in one file, make it more suitable for:\n",
    "- smartphones and other devices,\n",
    "- websites,\n",
    "- data analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to look for the alternative, if your project requires:\n",
    "- accessing the database from many computers at the same time,\n",
    "- simultaneous modification of the data by many users,\n",
    "- working with very large amounts of data (although it officially can handle up to 281 terabytes, having to keep it in one file is the bottleneck here).\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite has some unusual behaviours that are distinct from what you will find anywhere else. Everytime we face such behaviour, you will be informed about it. You can also get familiar with the full list in advance using [the official documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/quirks.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no single perfect solution, however features of SQLite make it an amazing candidate for learning. You will set it up in no time and achieve a great ratio of \"using SQL in practice\" vs \"struggling to setup the database\". Are you ready? Let's get it up and running :muscle:"

    "**Install SQLiteStudio**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches require having SQLiteStudio available on your computer at some point. So before we move on, let's install it first. SQLiteStudio is a program that provides a user-friendly interface to interact with SQLite. You can use it to actually *see* what's inside your database, run SQL queries, import data and many more. It's free, intuitive and very easy to start with. From this moment onwoards, it will be one of the main tools in your pocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few basic steps are needed to install SQLiteStudio.\n",
    "1. First, visit official [SQLiteStudio website](https://sqlitestudio.pl/) and click on the  \"Download\" button. A new zip file \"sqlitestudio-{version_number}.zip\" will be downloaded to your computer (at the moment of writing it's \"sqlitestudio-3.3.3.zip\").\n",
    "2. Unzip the file and move a new \"SQLiteStudio\" directory to the destination where you would like to permanently store it (e.g. your C:\\ drive). You can create a shortcut to \"SQLiteStudio.exe\" file for easy access e.g. from your Desktop.\n",
    "3. Open SQLiteStudio by double-clicking on the \"SQLiteStudio.exe\". \n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: You may be shown a Windows warning about opening non-trusted application. \"SQLiteStudio\" is an open source project and all of its code is available for the public. As you can find out in the official [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pawelsalawa/sqlitestudio), it's maintained for a couple of years and many people are using it. You should be able to safely ignore the warning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create a new database**\n",
    "You can now create a new datbase using SQLiteStudio. Just follow the steps below. If you prefer to do it with a command line, move on to the advanced section.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In SQLiteStudio click on the \"Database\" menu and then select \"Add a database\" option.\n",
    "2. Keep \"SQLite 3\" as a database type and click on a green icon \"Create new database file\".\n",
    "3. Remember that SQLite database is just a file? You can now specify path and name of your database file. I suggest `accomodation.db` as it's a pretty accurate description of the dataset that we will use later on.\n",
    "4. By checking the \"Permanent\" option you will make sure that you see your database each time you open the SQLiteStudio.\n",
    "5. You can \"Test connection\" before hitting \"OK\". If everything worked fine, you should be able to find a new `accomodation` database in the \"Databases\" pane on the left. Moreover, a new file should be created in the path that you've chosen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary>Advanced: create a new database with command line</summary>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes the process of creating a new database using an official way, described in the documentation. If for some reason you struggle to create a new database using this approach, it might be easier to use SQLiteStudio for this purpose. It's an alternative way of achieving the same results.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. First visit the SQLite [Download Page](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).Go to the \"Precompiled Binaries for Windows\" section and find the link for \"bundle of command-line tools\". Click on the link to download the .zip file.\n",

    "3. Open the unzipped catalog. You should see three files inside: \"sqldiff.exe\", \"sqlite3.exe\" and \"sqlite3_analyzer.exe\". Double-click on the \"sqldiff.exe\" to open it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You should now see a terminal where you can type in and run different SQLite commands. To create a database, you can use `.open your_path` command. You already know that SQLite database is contained in a single file. By adjusting `your_path` argument, you are able specify a path to this file. If you replace it with `./accomodation.db`, a new database will be created inside your current current directory. The full command would be `.open ./accomodation.db`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "> Tip: You can provide a full path if you want, but you will need to use \"/\" instead of \"\\\" when specifying it.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> Tip: If you don't see a database file, try typing `.databases` insinde the SQLite terminal and check once again.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. You can open your database using \"Add a database\" option from \"Database\" menu inside SQLiteStudio. You will need to provide a path to your file. You can keep all the other options unchanged.\n",

    "In one of the previous sections I told you that most of the database solutions share a common interface which is mainly based on tables. You've just created your first database from scratch, so you check if it's true. Right click on the `accomodation` database in the \"Databases\" pane and choose \"Connect to the database\" option from the menu. You should now see two icons: \"Tables\" and \"Views\". At this point there is nothing you can actually do. Your database is empty. To start seeing some data, you need to import it first.\n",

    "A common theme for all analytical projects is that you can't do analytics without data. How you actually get it, depends on the project. When you work for established company, you will most likely find the crucial datasets inside it's own, internal database. That's quite convenient as you don't have to prepare and upload the data yourself. However, eventually you may stumble upon limitations of the data at your disposal. You may also want to work on your personal project, where you start with no data at all. In such cases, you will need to import the datasets yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a high level, the process looks a follows. First, you need to find your dataset. Next, you need to download it. The final step is to import it to the database where you can process it with SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Find your dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ability to explore and use publically available datasets can be a very useful skill. There's no golden rule, but if you're looking for a specific dataset, you might want to check out sites like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [this repo](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets), [Dataset Search by Google](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) or [this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we already know what data will be used. It's a dataset with information about rental prices of different apartments offered via Airbnb in Bergamo, Italy. You can find this dataset on the [Inside Airbnb website](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). If you scroll down, you will find downloadable files with data for different cities in the world. For each city, you can get information about availibility, prices, ratings, aproximate location, amenities and many more. The coolest thing is that the data is refreshed each month, so it roughly reflects the current situation on Airbnb. If you want to learn more about Inside Airbnb and why this data was provided in the first place, make sure to visit the \"About\" page.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now download the data and upload it to the database, just follow the instructions below.\n",
    "1. Scroll down to find Bergamo on the list. Download three files: \"listings.csv.gz\", \"calendar.csv.gz\" and \"reviews.csv.gz\".\n",
    "2. Uncompress the files using dedicated program (7-Zip is a good one available for free). You should now see three .csv files on you computer.\n",
    "3. Open SQLiteStudio and right click on the database name in the \"Databases\" pane or click on the \"Tools\" menu and select the \"Import\" option.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: \"Import\" option will not be available if you haven't connected to the database as described at the very beginning of this section (right click on the name of the database and \"Connect to the database\").\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You will be asked to provide database name and table name. Let's start with \"calendar.csv\" file. Select `accomodation` database as it's the only one created so far. You can choose whatever name you want for your table but I'd suggest keeping it simple and aligned with the names of the files (\"calendar\", \"listings\" and \"reviews\" respecitvely). Type in the \"calendar\" and click on the \"Next\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: A good rule of thumb for the SQL development and other areas as well is to not make things more complicated than it's absolutely necessary. We could try to come up with better names for the tables, but having them aligned with the original files has the benefit of being an obvious solution. Imagine having not three but fifty tables and trying to figure out which file is the source of a given table if the naming is not aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You are now asked to specify a couple of options:\n",
    "    - data source type - the format of input file that you're using, \"CSV\" in our case;\n",
    "    - input file - path to the file with the data;\n",
    "    - text encoding - you can use default system encoding;\n",
    "    - ignore errors - whether you want to stop the import in case of any errors, make sure to leave it unchecked;\n",
    "    - first line represents CSV column names - whether the first row in your file represents column names;\n",
    "    - field separator - character that is used to separate columns in your file, comma in our case;\n",
    "    - null values - we'll explore this option later in the book, for now you can leave it unchecked.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```TODO: null values - explain somewhere in the book```\n",
    "\n",
    "    To make proper selection for some options, you need to know how your csv file is built. You can do it quite easily. Under the hood a .csv file is just a text document representing a table of data. Each new line represents a new row. Columns are separated with some character. Comma is the most popular choice, hence the name .csv (\"comma-separated values\"). You can also come across other separators, like semicolon (\";\") or tab (\"\\t\").\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```TODO: some picture to make it more understandable - example calendar.csv```\n",
    "\n",
    "    > Tip: Technically the .csv file extension is not perfect fit if comma is not used as a separator. However, you'll often see that people use it anyway, even if the separator is different. As it's still just a text file, it will work fine. You may also stumble upon a \"tsv\" file. It's a specific name for a file that uses tabs as separators. In most of the tools you should be able to import it using \"import csv\" option and selecting tab or \"\\t\" as your delimiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To check if the first line of \"calendar.csv\" file contains header, open it using any text editor. Notepad is the simplest option. Next, check content of the first line of your file. You will see values similar to: \"listing_id\", \"date\", \"available\", \"price\", etc. which definitely look like a column names. When importing this file, make sure to check \"first line represents CSV column names\" option in SQLiteStudio.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Last but not least, field separator. Looking at couple of the first rows, you can clearly see that values are separated with commas, e.g.:\n",
    "        - row 1: listing_id**,**date**,**available**,**price**,**adjusted_price**,**minimum_nights**,**maximum_nights;\n",
    "        - row 2: 15526**,**2021-03-30**,**f**,**\\$95.00**,**$95.00**,**2**,**1125.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Make sure to select \", (comma)\" as a field separator.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Click \"Finish\" to complete the process. After a short moment, you will see a new table in your database :champagne::champagne::champagne:\n",
    "7. Try to repeat the process for two remaining files: listings.csv and reviews.csv. In the end you should have three tables in your database \"calendar\", \"listings\" and \"reviews\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations, you've just completed the first step to get your data project up and running! As you may notice, it's a very simple dataset with just three tables of data. We'll switch to more complex datasets later in the book."

    "Before I give you answers, let me emphasize how cool it is to write code. In real or \"physical\" life, if you try some approach that doesn't work, most often than not, you break something. Usually it's painful because you need to either fix or replace whatever is broken. Writing code is a completely different world. Very often the worst thing that can happen is seeing an error. It's almost like you are in a wonderland where you can push your imagination to the limits withouth caring too much about consequences. Of course if you push to hard, you are capable of causing some damage but I can assure you that it won't happen while writing basic SQL queries. Having say that, I'd strongly recommend you pausing here for a moment an testing yourself what can happen if you violate any of the assumptions from the list above.\n",

    "Good news is that nothing exploded. Even better news is that it works exactly the same as the previous version. If it doesn't matter why bother splitting the code or making indentations? In short, all those things do not matter for the *computer*. The thing is that we're not computers. It's much more easy and predictable to read, modify and work with the query if it's nicely formatted. Especially if it's a long and a complex one. You can already notice the difference in the simple example above. Imagine having not ten but a hundred lines of code that you need to update.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your future self will probably not thank you if you take a good care about formatting. But you can be sure that it will curse if you don't. That's why this book follows a couple of simple principles when formatting code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new line for each main keyword (*SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY*), column, where condition, expression.\n",
    "2. Indent everything between main keywords.\n",
    "3. Use semicolon to split many queries written one after the other (it makes your editor aware that these are separate pieces of code).\n",
    "4. Capitalize keywords (that's my latest principle that I'm least strict about).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a set of principles that I've worked out using SQL for years. They tend to work very well for me. It's not fully comprehensive list and definitely not written in stone. As fair as I know, there is no one standard that everyone should follow. Feel free to experiment and modify the assumptions above to craft your own formatting style. As long as you keep your future self and your colleagues in mind, you should be fine."

The entire database is contained in just one file. Setting it up is trivial. It requires hardly any installation and no configuration at all. It's free, so you can use it to the limit without worring about the costs. Developers of the SQLite estimate that it's likely the [most popular database in the entire world](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html). They strive to keep it reliable until 2050. \n",

If you're using other OS, you might want to pick [Big Query](https://creaitive.studio/sql/2021/03/18/01_intro_big_query.html) instead. Having a browser installed is the only requirement to make it work.\n",

It's free, intuitive and very easy to start with. From this moment onwoards, it will be one of the main tools in your pocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few basic steps are needed to install SQLiteStudio.\n",
    "1. First, visit official [SQLiteStudio website](https://sqlitestudio.pl/) and click on the  \"Download\" button. A new zip file \"sqlitestudio-{version_number}.zip\" will be downloaded to your computer (at the moment of writing it's \"sqlitestudio-3.3.3.zip\").\n",
    "2. Unzip the file and move a new \"SQLiteStudio\" directory to the destination where you would like to permanently store it (e.g. your C:\\ drive). You can create a shortcut to \"SQLiteStudio.exe\" file for easy access e.g. from your Desktop.\n",
    "3. Open SQLiteStudio by double-clicking on the \"SQLiteStudio.exe\". \n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: You may be shown a Windows warning about opening non-trusted application. \"SQLiteStudio\" is an open source project and all of its code is available for the public. As you can find out in the official [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pawelsalawa/sqlitestudio), it's maintained for a couple of years and many people are using it. You should be able to safely ignore the warning.\n",

    "3. Remember that SQLite database is just a file? You can now specify path and name of your database file. I suggest `accomodation.db` as it's a pretty accurate description of the dataset that we will use later on.\n",
    "4. By checking the \"Permanent\" option you will make sure that you see your database each time you open the SQLiteStudio.\n",
    "5. You can \"Test connection\" before hitting \"OK\". If everything worked fine, you should be able to find a new `accomodation` database in the \"Databases\" pane on the left. Moreover, a new file should be created in the path that you've chosen before.\n",

    "4. You should now see a terminal where you can type in and run different SQLite commands. To create a database, you can use `.open your_path` command. You already know that SQLite database is contained in a single file. By adjusting `your_path` argument, you are able specify a path to this file. If you replace it with `./accomodation.db`, a new database will be created inside your current current directory. The full command would be `.open ./accomodation.db`.\n",

You can choose whatever name you want for your table but I'd suggest keeping it simple and aligned with the names of the files (\"calendar\", \"listings\" and \"reviews\" respecitvely). Type in the \"calendar\" and click on the \"Next\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: A good rule of thumb for the SQL development and other areas as well is to not make things more complicated than it's absolutely necessary. We could try to come up with better names for the tables, but having them aligned with the original files has the benefit of being an obvious solution. Imagine having not three but fifty tables and trying to figure out which file is the source of a given table if the naming is not aligned.\n",

    "    - input file - path to the file with the data;\n",

    "    To make proper selection for some options, you need to know how your csv file is built. You can do it quite easily. Under the hood a .csv file is just a text document representing a table of data. Each new line represents a new row. Columns are separated with some character. Comma is the most popular choice, hence the name .csv (\"comma-separated values\"). You can also come across other separators, like semicolon (\";\") or tab (\"\\t\").\n",

As it's still just a text file, it will work fine. You may also stumble upon a \"tsv\" file. It's a specific name for a file that uses tabs as separators. In most of the tools you should be able to import it using \"import csv\" option and selecting tab or \"\\t\" as your delimiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To check if the first line of \"calendar.csv\" file contains header, open it using any text editor. Notepad is the simplest option. Next, check content of the first line of your file. You will see values similar to: \"listing_id\", \"date\", \"available\", \"price\", etc. which definitely look like a column names. When importing this file, make sure to check \"first line represents CSV column names\" option in SQLiteStudio.\n",

You can see it by opening and browsing through your database management app. Another interface that is common for most of the database systems is *SQL*.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is a language that allows you to interact with a data inside a database. You can use it to do all kinds of manipulations, like: aggregations, custom calculations, filtering, sorting and so on. Let's go through a simple *SQL query* to see how it feels to use it. A *query* is a piece of SQL code that you can use to get data from a database. You can use it for example to feed data into report. This particular query was used to create a map in our report showing rental prices on Airbnb.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will now see what I meant by saying that SQL is such a friendly tool. It's a declarative language, which means that you don't need to specify all the low-lewel operations to get the desired result. You just need to describe the final outcome and the database will figure out the rest for you. If you have some basic knowledge of English, you may be suprised that a simple SQL query can be nearly understandable to you.\n",

    "It almost feels like a pseudocode. The cool thing is that it's an actual working query. You start with choosing or *selecting* columns that you want to use. Next, you specify which database and which table you want to get your data *from*. You only request rows *where* certain condition is met. Finally you put your results into specific *order*. You probably wouldn't be able to write it yourself but it makes an intuitive sence. We'll spend much more time learning how to build your own sql queries later in the book.\n",

    "You can try to execute this query inside the SQLiteStudio. Click on *Tools* in the top menu and select \"Open SQL editor\". You will see a new window where you can type some text. Copy or *even better* rewrite the SQL code inside this editor.\n",

Usually it's painful because you need to either fix or replace whatever is broken. Writing code is a completely different world. Very often the worst thing that can happen is seeing an error. It's almost like you are in a wonderland where you can push your imagination to the limits withouth caring too much about consequences. Of course if you push to hard, you are capable of causing some damage but I can assure you that it won't happen while writing basic SQL queries. Having say that, I'd strongly recommend you pausing here for a moment an testing yourself what can happen if you violate any of the assumptions from the list above.\n",

In short, all those things do not matter for the *computer*. The thing is that we're not computers. It's much more easy and predictable to read, modify and work with the query if it's nicely formatted. Especially if it's a long and a complex one. You can already notice the difference in the simple example above. Imagine having not ten but a hundred lines of code that you need to update.\n",

    "4. Capitalize keywords (that's my latest principle that I'm least strict about).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a set of principles that I've worked out using SQL for years. They tend to work very well for me. It's not fully comprehensive list and definitely not written in stone. As fair as I know, there is no one standard that everyone should follow. Feel free to experiment and modify the assumptions above to craft your own formatting style.

    "Do you remember the cult movie from 1999 \"The Matrix\"? There was this very memorable scene where Neo was given a choice between two pills, the red one and the blue one. He had a one in a lifetime opportunity to decide whether he wants to go on living in lie or find out the truth.\n",

    "There are two remarkable ascpects of this decision. First, one of the options feels to be objectively more \"correct\". No one wants his life to be a lie. Secondly, after making this decision, there was no way back, which made it an extremely difficult choice.\n",

    "At this point of the book, you also need to make a decision. There are many different database solutions and many different SQL flavours. This book covers couple of them, so you need to pick the one that you'll move on with. Compared to the dilemma that Neo faced, the decision that you are going to make is both easier and more difficult at the same time.\n",

All of them have advantages and disadvantages and there is no \"the right choice\". Fortunately, unlike the Neo, you don't need to live with this decision for the rest of your life. Quite the opposite! You can start with one tool and later on come back to try another one.\n",

It means that even if you learn one implementation of the SQL (e.g. SQLite) and want to switch to another one (e.g. PostgreSQL), you should be able to transfer most of your knowledge. To be clear, it doesn't mean that each vendor implements the language in an identical way. They try to follow the standard to some degree but there are some differences. Those discrepancie however are reasonable enough to make your knowledge universal most of the time. You will see a note whenever we stamble upon a solution that is very specific to given tool.\n",

    "In this section you'll see how to install the SQLite database. One of the reasons that SQLite is particurarly good starting point for learning is its simplicity. The entire database is contained in just one file. Setting it up is trivial. It requires hardly any installation and no configuration at all. It's free, so you can use it to its limits without worring about the costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beware and don't let the simplicity disguise you. It is a fully reliable database with most of the features that you would expect from the modern SQL database. It's characteristics make it a perfect choice for:\n",
    "- smartphones and other devices,\n",
    "- websites,\n",
    "- data analytics,\n",
    "- and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers of the SQLite boast that it's likely the [most popular database in the entire world](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html). They also strive to keep it reliable until 2050. \n",
    "\n",
    "Truth be told, SQLite as a bit different than its more traditional brothers - fully fledged relational database management systems (RDBMS), like PostgreSQL, SQL Server or Oracle. It's not a good choice for every use case. You may decide to choose an alternative, if your project requires:\n",
    "- accessing the database directly from many computers at the same time,\n",
    "- simultaneous modification of the data by many users,\n",
    "- working with very large amounts of data (although it officially can handle up to 281 terabytes, having to keep it in one file is the bottleneck here).\n",
    "\n",
    "It also has some unusual behaviours that are distinct from what you will find anywhere else. Everytime we face such behaviour, you will see be informed about it. You can also get familiar with the full list in advance using [the official documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/quirks.html). You can an example of a note below.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: SQLite is not a replacement for more traditional solutions. Unlike most databases it doesn't come with a dedicated server. That's why the use cases for this tool are different from use cases handled by standard database management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you should be aware that there's no single perfect database solution. Features of SQLite make it an amazing candidate for learning and that's why we use it as a default technology in this book. With SQLite you'll get a great ratio of \"using the SQL\" vs \"trying to setup the database\". Finally, if you're not sure which technology you should start with, remember, you're not like Neo. You are free to start with one option and switch to something else whenever you want. Most of your knowledge will be easily transferable."

To create a database, we need to use following command `.open your_path`, where `your_path` stands for the path of your new database. You can replace it with `./covid.db` that will create a new database inside your current directory. The full command would be `.open ./codiv.db`. If you wan't to provide a full path, you need to use \"/\" instead of \"\\\" to specify it.\n",

    "3. This step is optional but recommended. Move the \"SQLiteStudio\" folder to the place, where you would like to store it permamently (e.g. your C:\\ drive). You can create a shortcut to \"SQLiteStudio.exe\" file for easy access e.g. from your Desktop.\n",

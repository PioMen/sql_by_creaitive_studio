In this book, we take a slightly different approach. I will try to give you an amount of information that is \"just right\" to get a rough understanding of the subject and start practicing. This approach has many benefits. One of them is that you will find out very soon if SQL is difficult and fun for YOU.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: If you prefer to learn the more \"traditional\" way, \"SQL for Mere Mortals\" by John Viescas and Michael J. Hernandez (```TODO: add link```) is an amazing book that I can highly recommend.\n",

    "\n",
    "To give you an idea about what you may expect in this chapter, let me show you a plan that we will follow. First, I'll give you an example of the analytical project that was built using SQL. Then, you will go behind the curtain to get a step by step guide to recreate it on your own. At every step of the process, I will provide you with enough details to fully understand what you're doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get some first orientation in the subject, without spending too much time on a lengthy introduction. Here's a subjective list of 5 reasons why I think it's hard to not love the SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Easy to learn**\n",
    "If you are wondering if learning a computer language is for you, SQL is a great place to start. I believe that with the right approach, almost anyone can start using it comfortably in relatively short period of time (1-3 months). The syntax is very compact. All you need to do, is to get a good understanding of a couple of the basic operations and learn how to combine them in a Lego-like manner. With that gentle learning curce, you will very soon be able to see the first fruits of your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Friendly but powerfull**\n",
    "Learning a skill because it's easy to learn would make no sense if it was a uselless skill. Fortunately with SQL you get an awesome impact effort ratio. You can use it to work with all kinds of datasets (from hundreds, to billions of rows). That makes you quite capable in a data world.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Great starting point**\n",
    "Being so easy to learn but at the same time, so powerful, SQL is a great choice if you want to start your career in IT. As you probably know, the role of data in a modern world is increasing rapidly. There is a huge demand for professionals who know how to deal with data. It's not too challenging to find a satisfying job if you master this skill. What a bargain!\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Strong foundation**\n",
    "Learning a language is just one part of working with data. Knowing how to do it efficiently is a whole different story. With SQL, you can get your hands dirty relatively quickly. It will allow you to learn skills that are hard to acquire otherwise. By that I mean things like being able to assess quality of the data, clean the data, verify quality of your scripts and debugging. These skills are transferable. You can easily build on them if you decide to take on a new tool for working with the data, like Python or Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Sweetspot between IT and business**\n",
    "There is a group of people who like coding but could not imagine themself doing it day after day, all day long. If that sounds familiar, you'll be happy to know that it's not the only option. With SQL, you can look for a career path that involves reporting or analytics. The scope of work will obviously differ in a different companies, but most of the time, these kind of positions will give you a heathy balance of business problem solving, communication and coding.\n",
    "PS. Don't worry if you actually are into hardcore coding marathons, you should be able to find something for yourself too.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: **SQL vs spreadsheets** If you are coming from a spreadsheet world, you probably wonder how does working with SQL compare to working with spreadsheets. The main benefit is that SQL is much better at providing consistency. Have you ever failed to update your formula when refreshing your report? That will not happen with SQL. You design your logic and keep it in an SQL script that will work exactly the same each and every time. It's like you took all of your knowledge about what you need to do and wrote it down in a file. You don't need to do every step yourself. You dramatically reduce the risk of a human error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To be fair, like any other tool, SQL has it's own limitations as well. Here's the major one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Limited by design**\n",
    "It's more of a feature that an issue but SQL was designed with a specific purpose in mind: manipulating data in a database. Having this assumption makes it a very friendly, logical and coherent language for this purpose. But it's fair to point out that it also imposes some limitations. If you're looking for a single tool that will manipulate the data, create some charts, save them to pdf and sent via e-mail - SQL is not a go to solution. It's a choice between versatility and accessibility. You can find tools that are more universal but they will surely have a steeper learning curve. SQL provides a great balance between the two.\n",
    "```TODO: matrix - how complex vs how universal the tool is```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so these are the main benefits of learning SQL. I hope that you now have a feeling about how accessible and enabling this skill is. I encourage you to give it a try. You will love it!`"

    "There are lots of reasons why you might want to learn a new skill. People are usually more succesfull when they have a very explicit goal in mind. So before you jump in to the book for good, take a minute or two, to think about your motivation. By motivation I mean, a specific outcome that you want to get after completing the material.

    "In one of the previous sections I told you that most of the database solutions share a common interface which is mainly based on tables. You've just created your first database from scratch, so you check if it's true. Right click on the `accomodation` database in the \"Databases\" pane and choose \"Connect to the database\" option from the menu. You should now see two icons: \"Tables\" and \"Views\". At this point there is nothing you can actually do. Your database is empty. To start seeing some data, you need to import it first.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common theme for all analytical projects is that you can't do analytics without data. How you actually get it, depends on the project. When you work for established company, you will most likely find the crucial datasets inside it's own, internal database. That's quite convenient as you don't have to prepare and upload the data yourself. However, eventually you may stumble upon limitations of the data at your disposal. You may also want to work on your personal project, where you start with no data at all. In such cases, you will need to import the datasets yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a high level, the process looks a follows. First, you need to find your dataset. Next, you need to download it. The final step is to import it to the database where you can process it with SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Find your dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ability to explore and use publically available datasets can be a very useful skill. There's no golden rule, but if you're looking for a specific dataset, you might want to check out sites like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [this repo](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets), [Dataset Search by Google](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) or [this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we already know what data will be used. It's a dataset with information about rental prices of different apartments offered via Airbnb in Bergamo, Italy. You can find this dataset on the [Inside Airbnb website](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). If you scroll down, you will find downloadable files with data for different cities in the world. For each city, you can get information about availibility, prices, ratings, aproximate location, amenities and many more. The coolest thing is that the data is refreshed each month, so it roughly reflects the current situation on Airbnb. If you want to learn more about Inside Airbnb and why this data was provided in the first place, make sure to visit the \"About\" page.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now download the data and upload it to the database, just follow the instructions below.\n",
    "1. Scroll down to find Bergamo on the list. Download three files: \"listings.csv.gz\", \"calendar.csv.gz\" and \"reviews.csv.gz\".\n",
    "2. Uncompress the files using dedicated program (7-Zip is a good one available for free). You should now see three .csv files on you computer.\n",
    "3. Open SQLiteStudio and right click on the database name in the \"Databases\" pane or click on the \"Tools\" menu and select the \"Import\" option.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: \"Import\" option will not be available if you haven't connected to the database as described at the very beginning of this section (right click on the name of the database and \"Connect to the database\").\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You will be asked to provide database name and table name. Let's start with \"calendar.csv\" file. Select `accomodation` database as it's the only one created so far. You can choose whatever name you want for your table but I'd suggest keeping it simple and aligned with the names of the files (\"calendar\", \"listings\" and \"reviews\" respecitvely). Type in the \"calendar\" and click on the \"Next\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: A good rule of thumb for the SQL development and other areas as well is to not make things more complicated than it's absolutely necessary. We could try to come up with better names for the tables, but having them aligned with the original files has the benefit of being an obvious solution. Imagine having not three but fifty tables and trying to figure out which file is the source of a given table if the naming is not aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You are now asked to specify a couple of options:\n",
    "    - data source type - the format of input file that you're using, \"CSV\" in our case;\n",
    "    - input file - path to the file with the data;\n",
    "    - text encoding - you can use default system encoding;\n",
    "    - ignore errors - whether you want to stop the import in case of any errors, make sure to leave it unchecked;\n",
    "    - first line represents CSV column names - whether the first row in your file represents column names;\n",
    "    - field separator - character that is used to separate columns in your file, comma in our case;\n",
    "    - null values - we'll explore this option later in the book, for now you can leave it unchecked.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```TODO: null values - explain somewhere in the book```\n",
    "\n",
    "    To make proper selection for some options, you need to know how your csv file is built. You can do it quite easily. Under the hood a .csv file is just a text document representing a table of data. Each new line represents a new row. Columns are separated with some character. Comma is the most popular choice, hence the name .csv (\"comma-separated values\"). You can also come across other separators, like semicolon (\";\") or tab (\"\\t\").\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```TODO: some picture to make it more understandable - example calendar.csv```\n",
    "\n",
    "    > Tip: Technically the .csv file extension is not perfect fit if comma is not used as a separator. However, you'll often see that people use it anyway, even if the separator is different. As it's still just a text file, it will work fine. You may also stumble upon a \"tsv\" file. It's a specific name for a file that uses tabs as separators. In most of the tools you should be able to import it using \"import csv\" option and selecting tab or \"\\t\" as your delimiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To check if the first line of \"calendar.csv\" file contains header, open it using any text editor. Notepad is the simplest option. Next, check content of the first line of your file. You will see values similar to: \"listing_id\", \"date\", \"available\", \"price\", etc. which definitely look like a column names. When importing this file, make sure to check \"first line represents CSV column names\" option in SQLiteStudio.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Last but not least, field separator. Looking at couple of the first rows, you can clearly see that values are separated with commas, e.g.:\n",
    "        - row 1: listing_id**,**date**,**available**,**price**,**adjusted_price**,**minimum_nights**,**maximum_nights;\n",
    "        - row 2: 15526**,**2021-03-30**,**f**,**\\$95.00**,**$95.00**,**2**,**1125.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Make sure to select \", (comma)\" as a field separator.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Click \"Finish\" to complete the process. After a short moment, you will see a new table in your database :champagne:\n",
    "7. Try to repeat the process for two remaining files: listings.csv and reviews.csv. At the end you should have three tables in your database \"calendar\", \"listings\" and \"reviews\"."

It's almost like you are in a wonderland where you can push your imagination to the limits withouth caring too much about consequences. Of course if you push to hard, you are capable of causing some damage but I can assure you that it won't happen while writing basic SQL queries.
